# oomph

My personal Oomph setups for Eclipse.

## Java

The setup for Java development is in the file com.marcandregoyette.eclipse.java.setup. It also includes plugins for JavaScript and TypeScript development.

It is based on the Eclipse for Java EE Developers product, but without the following features:
- Cloud Foundry plugins. I don't use Cloud Foundry.
- Data Tools Platform plugins. I prefer to use dedicated applications or command line to interact with a database).
- Mylin plugins. I don't use Mylin. Mylin will still be required because of other plugins, but I prefer to not list Mylin as a requirement.
